description: How to plot interactive and animated maps in R, with gganimate and plotly.

Here I show how to go from fetching R-Ladies' chapters' Twitter accounts, to plotting them in an interactive map using `plotly` and animating the map using `gganimate` to produce this .gif file.

Recently [I came across this post](http://spatial.ly/2017/03/mapping-5000-years-of-city-growth/), and I knew I had to make a similar map for the [R-Ladies' chapters](http://rladies.org/) (probably the purple color had plenty to do with that üíú ). So my idea was to plot all the R-Ladies' chapters in a map according to their size. I thought of using their Twitter followers as a way to estimate it, since it's the most extended social media they use (except for a few chapters).  

As I don't want this to be an extremely large post (like my first one üôÑ ) I decided to make 3 posts to go through the details of what I've done (especially for future me!):

  * [How to fetch Twitter users with R]({% post_url 2017-04-20-how-to-fetch-twitter-users-with-r %}){:target="_blank"}: the title is kind of self explanatory...
  * [How to deal with ggplotly huge maps]({% post_url 2017-04-26-how-to-deal-with-ggplotly-huge-maps %}){:target="_blank"}: where I go through the details of why I chose not to use `ggplotly` and use `plot_geo` instead to generate HTML.
  * [How to plot animated maps with gganimate]({% post_url 2017-04-24-how-to-plot-animated-maps-with-gganimate %}){:target="_blank"}: again, pretty obvious subject.

This post is the most general one about this project, where I don't get into so many details of what I do, focusing on the visualization results.

Also, I should warn you that there are a lot of emojis in this post, courtesy of the `emo` package Hadley recently released and I fanatically adopted üòá

So here I go!

# Fetching R-Ladies' chapters' Twitter accounts

I had to learn how to retrieve data from the Twitter API, and I chose to use the `rtweet` package, which is super easy to use! Since I only use public data I don't have to worry about getting my Twitter personal access token. 

Every R-Ladies' chapter uses a standard handle, with the *RLadiesLocation* format (I'm surprised about how very compliant with this!). 1000 is the maximum number of users returned from a single search, which is not a problem for now but it looks like it will be in the near future, as you are about to see! 




```r
library(rtweet)

users <- search_users(q = 'RLadies',
                      n = 1000,
                      parse = TRUE)
```

Let's see what it returns:


```r
library(DT)
datatable(users[, c(2:5)], rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(pageLength = 5))
```

I chose to use `DT::datatable` just in case someone wants to go through whats on the whole table (of course here I'm thinking about the R-Ladies üíú ). It was not easy to set up the environment for my blog to show this table (it uses `HTML widgets`), but luckily my hubby was more than willing to help me with that part üòÖ . If you are using RStudio it is just as simple as installing the `DT` package, or you can always use `knitr::kable(head(users[, c(2:5)]), format = "html")` to see the first rows.

## Cleaning the data

I have to make sure I don't have any duplicates, and keep only the handles that comply with the stipulated format, using a regular expression. I filter out 3 additional handles: _'RLadies'_ (whose _name_ is _'Royal Ladies'_ and I assume has something to do with royalty by the crown on their picture), _'RLadies\_LF'_ (a Japanese account that translated as follows on _Google Translator_: _'Rakuten Ichiba fashion delivery'_), and _'RLadiesGlobal'_, because it is not a chapter, so I don't want to include it on the plot. 

There are two additional chapters with no presence on Twitter: one in Taipei, Taiwan, and the other in Warsaw, Poland. I add them according to their creation date and using the number of members on their Meetup account as followers.

To plot the chapters on a map, I need to obtain the latitude and longitude for each one of them. The `ggmap` package really comes in handy for this. It interacts with _Google Maps_ to retrieve latitude and longitude, and I don't even have to worry about getting the location into a specific format, because it is so good at interpreting it! (I actually tried extracting the cities first, because I thought it would be the best way, but many of the chapters didn't match or matched wrongly, so I tried it like that and worked perfectly!)

Since the `ggmap::geocode` function returns 2 columns, I decided to use the `purrr::map` function for capturing both values in a single column of the dataframe, and then with `tidyr::unnest` I transform it into two separate columns. All of this with never having to leave the `tidyverse` world :)


```r
library(ggmap)
library(purrr)

rladies <- rladies %>% 
  mutate(longlat = purrr::map(.$location, geocode)) %>% 
  unnest() 

datatable(rladies, rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(pageLength = 5))   
```

Now the dataframe is ready for me to use it for visualizing these Twitter users on a map (considering their sizes and dates of creation), and make some animations.

# Making the map interactive using plotly

The first thing I did was generate the map using `ggplot2`, because `plotly` integrates easily with it via the `ggplotly` function. And I'm so comfortable using the `tidyverse`, that it was the natural thing for me to do! But (huge but!) by the time I wanted to show that map on my blog, it took forever to load the HTML! And that is why I checked how the `plotly` people make this kind of maps from scratch, and I gave it a try.


```r
library(plotly)
g <- list(showframe = FALSE,
          coastlinecolor = toRGB("white"),
          showland = TRUE,
          landcolor = toRGB("gray80"),
          showcountries = TRUE,
          countrycolor = toRGB("white"),
          countrywidth = 0.2,
          projection = list(type = 'Mercator'))

plot_geo(rladies,
         marker = list(color = toRGB("purple"),
                       opacity = 0.5,
                       line = list(color = toRGB("purple"),
                                   width = 1.5))) %>%
  add_markers(x = ~lon,
              y = ~lat,
              sizes = c(1, 450),
              size = ~followers,
              hoverinfo = "text",
              text = ~paste('city: ', location,
                            '<br /> created: ', created_at,
                            '<br /> followers: ', followers)) %>%
  layout(geo = g)
```

I love this `plotly` map, but it requires an interaction to take full advantage of it. And I wanted to generate a visualization able to be captured on a .gif file so I could share it on Twitter and other social media... And that's when I thought of `gganimate`.

# Animating the map using gganimate

Animating a map using `gganimate` takes 2 steps: 

  * [plot a map using `ggplot2`](#plot_map)
  * [animate it using `gganimate`](#animate_map)

<a id="plot_map"> </a>
## Plotting the map

I use the `maps` package to get the world map, using the `ggplot2::ggplot` and `ggthemes::theme_map` functions for plotting it nicely. And then I plot the chapters... I think you can guess the `geom_point` colour I chose üòù 


```r
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(ggthemes)

map <- ggplot() +
  borders("world", colour = "gray85", fill = "gray80") +
  theme_map() +
  geom_point(aes(x = lon, y = lat,
                 size = followers),
             data = rladies,
             colour = 'purple', alpha = .5) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 8),
                        breaks = c(250, 500, 750, 1000)) +
  labs(size = 'Followers')
```

## Animating the map

Now let's animate the map! The core thing here is that I want every chapter appearing in the order it was created, to somehow tell a story with the map. Lets start by animating `map`: the `ggplot` object we just created. I have to make a few changes for `gganimate` to work:

- `gganimate` requires a `frame` aesthetic: I'll use the `created_at` variable. You set this as a new aesthetic in `ggplot` which is ignored by it (as shown in the warning messages), but `gganimate` recognizes and uses it;

- I also add the `cumulative = TRUE`, an additional aesthetic  (same comment about `ggplot` ignoring it), so once the chapter appears on the map, it keeps showing in all following frames.

Taking a friend's suggestion, I add an empty frame at the beginning, so that the first frame you see is just the empty map. I generate a dataframe with some random data (this data will not be visible), with the same structure than the original dataframe, as follows.


```r
ghost_point <- rladies %>%
  add_row(
    created_at = as.Date('2011-09-01'),
    followers = 0,
    lon = 0,
    lat = 0,
    .before = 1) %>%
  slice(1)
```

Then I add an extra layer to the `ggplot`, the second `geom_point`, but with the `alpha` parameter set to `0`, so the point will not show in the plot.


```r
map <- ggplot() +
  borders("world", colour = "gray85", fill = "gray80") +
  theme_map() +
  geom_point(aes(x = lon, y = lat,
                 size = followers,
                 frame = created_at,
                 cumulative = TRUE),
             data = rladies, colour = 'purple', alpha = .5) +
  geom_point(aes(x = lon, y = lat,  # this is the transparent frame
                 size = followers,
                 frame = created_at,
                 cumulative = TRUE),
             data = ghost_point, alpha = 0) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 10), breaks = c(250, 500, 750, 1000)) +
  labs(size = 'Followers')

library(gganimate)
ani.options(interval = 0.2)
gganimate(map)
```

This animation is so cool! It shows how R-Ladies is spreading all over the globe, giving also some idea of how it is growing.

## Customizing the animation

How cool would it be if each point could start small when the chapter is founded and reach its full size today?? This idea actually came from my husband, and I thought it would be awesome to actually visualize R-Ladies growing frame by frame! 

I only have each chapter once in the `rladies` dataframe, with the creation date and amount of followers. To create new frames for the `gganimate`, I have to replicate each chapter with intermediate number of followers (I assume linear growth of followers) for each intermediate date. I do that by creating a dataframe of dates from the first R-Ladies chapter was created until today (to make this analysis reproducible I assume today is 2017-05-15), and keep only the dates 1, 10 and 20 of each month (I could keep all dates but It would not improve the quality much and it would generate a heavier animation).


```r
library(tibble)
library(lubridate)

dates <- as_tibble(seq(floor_date(min(rladies$created_at),
                                  unit = "month"),
                       as.Date('2017-05-15'),
                       by = 'days')) %>%
  filter(day(value) %in% c(1, 10, 20))
```

Then I generate a new dataframe with every chapter appearing once for every intermediate date from its creation date until today. I assume the number of followers increasing linearly.

I remove some frames from the beginning, because R-Ladies proliferated all over the globe in the past year or so but it took a long time from the creation of the first chapter until it started to get traction. The last part of the animation would be really fast in comparison ([you can check this animation in this post]({% post_url 2017-04-24-how-to-plot-animated-maps-with-gganimate %}#skipping){:target="_blank"}, so I take the _R-Ladies London_ creation as a turning point, and before that date (2016-04-20) I only keep one frame every 6 months. It's a compromise I made: I sacrificed the accuracy of the time scale for the sake of a nicer visualization (and a reduction in the amount of frames!) ü§∑


```r
library(tidyr)

rladies_frames <- rladies %>%
  select(screen_name) %>%
  expand(screen_name, date = dates$value) %>%
  right_join(rladies, by = 'screen_name') %>%
  filter(date > created_at) %>%
  mutate(date = format(date, format = '%Y-%m-%d'),
         age_total = as.numeric(age_days, units = 'days'),
         age_at_date = as.numeric(difftime(date, created_at, unit = 'days'),
                                  units = 'days'),
         est_followers = ((followers - 1) / age_total) * age_at_date)%>%
  filter((day(date) == 1 & month(date) %% 6 == 0) |
           date >= rladies$created_at[rladies$screen_name == 'RLadiesLondon'])

ghost_point <-  ghost_point %>%
  mutate(date = format(created_at, format = '%Y-%m-%d'),
         est_followers = 0)

map_frames <- ggplot() +
  borders("world", colour = "gray85", fill = "gray80") +
  theme_map() +
  geom_point(aes(x = lon, y = lat,
                 size = est_followers,
                 frame = date),
             data = rladies_frames, colour = 'purple', alpha = .5) +
  geom_point(aes(x = lon, y = lat,
                 size = est_followers,
                 frame = date),
             data = ghost_point, alpha = 0) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 10), breaks = c(250, 500, 750, 1000)) +
  labs(size = 'Followers')

ani.options(interval = .15)
gganimate(map_frames)
```

![map_frames](/figure/source/visualizing-r-ladies-growth/2017-05-10-visualizing-r-ladies-growth/map_frames.gif)

# Creating the .gif

The only thing left is to save the animation to a file, in this case I choose a `.gif`, but you can also choose to save it as .mp4, .swf or .html (each requiring specific drivers, [check the documentation here](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate))


```r
gganimate(map_frames, interval = .15, filename = 'rladies.gif')
```

I wanted a .gif file to share it on Twitter, Slack and other social media, so I could post something like this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RLadies?src=hash">#RLadies</a> is growing!
